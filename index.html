					<h1>Digital Prescription</h1>					
					<p>
						The project aims to build a software that can digitize a doctor’s
prescription system. A chemist can use this software to upload the
scanned image of the doctor’s prescription and result to a digital textbased
prescription. A doctor is still allowed to write the prescription in
the conventional way.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Uses</h1>					
					<p>
						The major reason due
to which the need of this software arises is the haphazard and hasty
handwriting of the doctors which leads to wrong dosages and/or wrong
medicine being given to the patient. This might cause the worsening
of the condition of the patient, which may result in risky consequences,
including death. This software aims to recognise the text in the
prescription, correct any form of grammatical errors and present an
error-free template of the prescription.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h1>Methodolgy</h1><br>					
					<ul> <li>Image pre-processing using opencv. <li>Used Microsoft Vision API for text detection and word level segmentation. 
						<li>Developed a probabilistic model which predicts the correction of the name of medicines detected in the prescription. </ul>
